          <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Travel isn't just about destinations‚Äîit's about transformation. Every journey teaches us 
              something new about the world and ourselves. We believe in slow travel, deep cultural 
              immersion, and creating meaningful connections with people and places.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our adventures take us beyond tourist trails to discover hidden gems, local traditions, 
              and authentic experiences. We document these moments not just to remember them, but to 
              inspire others to see the world through curious, open eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              From bustling markets in Southeast Asia to quiet mountain villages in South America, 
              every destination becomes a classroom where we learn about history, culture, cuisine, 
              and what it means to be human in this diverse world.

              Education doesn't have to happen within four walls. Worldschooling combines travel 
              with learning, turning the entire world into our children's classroom. Ancient ruins 
              become history lessons, foreign languages become practical skills, and diverse cultures 
              become social studies in action.
            </p>
            <p>
              We share our experiences with curriculum planning, educational resources, and practical 
              tips for families considering this unconventional educational path. From managing time 
              zones during online classes to finding educational opportunities in every destination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our worldschooling journey proves that learning can be exciting, relevant, and deeply 
              meaningful when it connects directly to real-world experiences and global perspectives.

                We're the Johnson family‚ÄîMark, Sarah, and our two kids, Emma (12) and Jake (9). 
                Three years ago, we made the bold decision to sell our house, quit our corporate jobs, 
                and embark on a full-time travel adventure with our children.

                Mark brings 15 years of photography experience, while Sarah has a background

                adventure, learning, and visual storytelling that defines our nomadic lifestyle.

                Our mission is to inspire other families to think outside the box, whether that means

                about how travel can enrich your family's life and financial future.
